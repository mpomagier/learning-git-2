          Count down the thunder<br>
          I think we're too close for comfort<br>
          So no, don't rock the boat and don't calm the storm<br>
          God already gave you His answer<br>
          Blink, I'm sorry, it's over, the whistle's been blown, I<br>
          Think you got the wrong number, I'm breaking up<br>
          Wanna make a connection, can't get no reception<br>
          Leave a message after the tone<br>

        <p class="pre-chorus">
        'Cause it's got my head running 24/7<br>
        I don't know if I can figure it out<br>
        It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure<br>
        We're so full of<br>

          Don't move a muscle<br>
          No, we can't have a struggle<br>
          But the situation is in control<br>
          So play pretend that it's all good<br>
          You could tell the Messiah<br>
          His pants are on fire, I politely decline, I<br>
          I gotta go, I gotta stick my head in the sand<br>
          And block out all the sadness, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>

          (We're so full of)<br>
          And we all march on like we know the way to Heaven<br>
          Who the hell died and made you the king?<br>
          We don't know what we want, but we know that we want it<br>
          Yeah, we want it, yeah, we want it right now<br>
